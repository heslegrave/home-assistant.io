The `rfxtrx` integration supports RFXtrx devices by [RFXCOM](http://www.rfxcom.com), which communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Cover](#covers)
- [Light](#lights)
- [Switch](#switches)
- [Sensor](#sensors)
- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensors)

To enable RFXtrx in your installation, something like the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.

*Direct serial connection*

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for local serial device
rfxtrx:
  device: /dev/ttyUSB0
```

*Network connection*

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for TCP connected device using ser2net
rfxtrx:
  host: 192.168.0.2
  port: 50000
```

*Network connection with multiple devices*

```yaml
# Example configuration with several devices
rfxtrx:
  host: 192.168.0.2
  port: 50000
  devices:
    # Siemens/LightwaveRF Shutter

## Supported protocols

Not all protocols as advertised are enabled on the initial setup of your transceiver. Enabling all protocols is not recommended either. Your 433.92 product not showing in the logs? Visit the RFXtrx website to [download RFXmgmr](http://www.rfxcom.com/epages/78165469.sf/en_GB/?ViewObjectPath=%2FShops%2F78165469%2FCategories%2FDownloads) and enable the required protocol.

### ser2net

You can host your device on another computer by setting up ser2net and example configuration for ser2net looks like this and then using host/port in your Home Assistant configuration.

```text
50000:raw:0:/dev/ttyUSB0:38400 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT
```

## Setting up your devices

Once you have set up your [RFXtrx hub](/integrations/rfxtrx/), the easiest way
to find your binary sensors is to enable automatic add in  `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rfxtrx:
  automatic_add: true
  host: 192.168.0.2
  port: 50000
```

Open your Home Assistant frontend and go to the "states" page.
Then make sure to trigger your sensor. You should see several new entities
appear in the *Current entities* list, by looking at the entities attribute, you can look at the last received event, which can be added to the configuration.

For example: "0913000022670e013b70". Then you should update your configuration to:

```yaml
rfxtrx:
  automatic_add: false
  host: 192.168.0.2
  port: 50000
  devices:
    0913000022670e013b70:
```

### Covers

The `rfxtrx` platform supports Siemens/LightwaveRF and RFY roller shutters that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

##### RFY

The [RFXtrx433e](http://www.rfxcom.com/RFXtrx433E-USB-43392MHz-Transceiver/en) is required for RFY support, however, it does not support receive for the RFY protocol - as such devices cannot be automatically added. Instead, configure the device in the [rfxmngr](http://www.rfxcom.com/downloads.htm) tool. Make a note of the assigned ID and Unit Code and then add a device to the configuration with the following id `071a0000[id][unit_code]`. E.g., if the id was `0a` `00` `01`, and the unit code was `01` then the fully qualified id would be `071a00000a000101`, if you set your id/code to single digit in the rfxmngr, e.g., id: `1` `02` `04` and unit code: `1` you will need to add `0` before, so `102031` becomes `071a000001020301`.

### Lights

The `rfxtrx` platform support lights that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

Make sure you trigger a dimming command to get switches detected as lights otherwise, they will show up as switches.

#### Convert switch event to dimming event

To convert a standard switch to a light, use the [Light Switch](/integrations/light.switch/) component.

To convert a switch to a dimmable light, make sure the event contain a dimming command. You can usually convert a command by changing one byte.

### Switches

The `rfxtrx` platform support switches that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

### Sensors

The `rfxtrx` platform support sensors that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

Also, several switches and other devices will also expose sensor entities with battery status as well as the signal level.

### Binary Sensors

The `rfxtrx` platform support binary sensors that
communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.
The RFXtrx binary sensor integration provides support for them.

Many cheap sensors available on the web today are based on a particular RF chip
called *PT-2262*. Depending on the running firmware on the RFXcom box, some of
them may be recognized under the X10 protocol, but most of them are recognized
under the *Lighting4* protocol. The RFXtrx binary sensor integration provides
some special options for them, while other RFXtrx protocols should work too.

#### Off Delay

Binary sensors have only two states - "on" and "off". Many door or window
opening sensors will send a signal each time the door/window is open or closed.
However, depending on their hardware or on their purpose,
some sensors are only able to signal their "on" state:

- Most motion sensors send a signal each time they detect motion. They stay "on" for a few seconds and go back to sleep, ready to signal other motion events. Usually, they do not send a signal when they go back to sleep.
- Some doorbells may also only send "on" signals when their toggle switch is pressed, but no "off" signal when the switch is released.

For those devices, use the *off_delay* parameter.
It defines a delay after, which a device will go back to an "Off" state.
That "Off" state will be fired internally by Home Assistant, just as if
the device fired it by itself. If a motion sensor can only send signals
once every 5 seconds, sets the *off_delay* parameter to *seconds: 5*.

Example configuration:

```yaml
rfxtrx:
  automatic_add: false
  host: 192.168.0.2
  port: 50000
  devices:
    091300006ca2c6001080:
      device_class: motion
      off_delay:
        seconds: 5
```

#### Options for PT-2262 devices under the Lighting4 protocol

When a data packet is transmitted by a PT-2262 device using the Lighting4
protocol, there is no way to automatically extract the device identifier and the
command from the packet. Each device has its own id/command length combination
and the field lengths are not included in the data. One device that sends 2
different commands will be seen as 2 devices on Home Assistant. For such cases,
the following options are available in order to circumvent the problem:

- **data_bits** (*Optional*)
- **command_on** (*Optional*)
- **command_off** (*Optional*)

Let's try to add a new PT-2262 sensor using the "automatic_add"
option and have a look at Home Assistant system log.

Have your sensor trigger the "On" state for the first time.
Some messages will appear:

```text
INFO (Thread-6) [homeassistant.components.binary_sensor.rfxtrx] Added binary sensor 0913000022670e013970 (Device_id: 22670e Class: LightingDevice Sub: 0)
```

Here the sensor has the id *22670e*.

Now have your sensor trigger the "Off" state and look for the following
message in the Home Assistant log. You should see that your device
has been detected as a *new* device when triggering its "Off" state:

```text
INFO (Thread-6) [homeassistant.components.binary_sensor.rfxtrx] Added binary sensor 09130000226707013d70 (Device_id: 226707 Class: LightingDevice Sub: 0)
```

Here the device id is *226707*, which is almost similar to
the *22670e* we had on the "On" event a few seconds ago.

From those two values, you can guess that the actual id of your device is
*22670*, and that *e* and *7* are commands for "On" and "Off" states
respectively. As one hexadecimal digit uses 4 bits,
we can conclude that the device is using 4 data bits.

So, here is the actual configuration section for the binary sensor:

```yaml
rfxtrx:
  automatic_add: false
  host: 192.168.0.2
  port: 50000
  devices:
    0913000022670e013b70:
      device_class: opening
      data_bits: 4
      command_on: 0xe
      command_off: 0x7
```

The *automatic_add* option makes the RFXtrx binary sensor integration calculate
and display the configuration options for you in the Home Assistant logs:

```text
INFO (Thread-6) [homeassistant.components.rfxtrx] rfxtrx: found possible device 226707 for 22670e with the following configuration:
data_bits=4
command_on=0xe
command_off=0x7
INFO (Thread-6) [homeassistant.components.binary_sensor.rfxtrx] Found possible matching deviceid 22670e.
```

This automatic guess should work most of the time, but there is
no guarantee on that. You should activate it only when you
want to configure your new devices and leave it off otherwise.

#### Known working devices

The following devices are known to work with the RFXtrx binary sensor component.
There are too many other to list.

- Motion detectors:
  - Kerui P817 and P829.
  - Chuango PIR-700.

- Door / window sensors:
  - Kerui D026 door / window sensor: can trigger on "open" and "close". Has a tamper switch.
  - Nexa LMST-606.

## Events

The RFXtrx integration will signal an event on the reception of messages from and RFXtrx device on the following form. For the signal to be available, the `fire_event` parameter must be set on the device in configuration.

*Signal from a byron doorbell button:*

```yaml
packet_type: 22
sub_type: 0
type_string: "Byron SX"
id_string: "00:90"
data: "0716000100900970"
values:
  Sound: 9
  Battery numeric: 0
  Rssi numeric: 7
```

*Event data from a Nexa wall socket switch:*

```yaml
packet_type: 16
sub_type: 1
type_string: 'ARC'
id_string': 'C3'
data: '0710010143030170'
values': 
  Command: 'On'
  Rssi numeric': 7
```

You can setup automations to react to these events. When you do don't include more fields than needed. Always include the device identifying fields, `packet_type`, `sub_type` and `id_string`.

So, for example, to trigger an action when somebody presses the doorbell, you would set up an automation with the following trigger:

*Automation trigger:*

```yaml
- platform: event
  event_type: rfxtrx_event
  event_data:
    packet_type: 22
    sub_type: 0
    id_string: "00:90"
    values:
      Sound: 9
```

*A more complete example with scene activation:*

```yaml
light:
  platform: demo

scene:
  name: WelcomeScene
  entities:
    light.bed_light: on
    light.ceiling_lights: off

automation:
  - alias: Use doorbell button to trigger scene
    trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: rfxtrx_event
      event_data:
        packet_type: 22
        sub_type: 0
        id_string: "00:90"
        values:
          Sound: 9
    action:
      service: scene.turn_on
      entity_id: scene.welcomescene
```

## Services

- `rfxtrx.send`: Send a custom event using the RFXtrx device.

#### Service: Send

Simulate a button being pressed:

```yaml
...
action:
  service: rfxtrx.send
  data:
    event: 0b1111e003af16aa10000060
```


## Generate codes

If you need to generate codes for switches and lights, you can use a template (useful for example COCO switches).

- Go to home-assistant-IP:8123/dev-template
- Use the follwing codes to generate an event:

*Switch: ARC*

{% raw %}

```yaml
0b11000{{ range(100,700) | random | int }}bc0cfe0{{ range(0,10) | random | int }}010f70
```

{% endraw %}

*Light: ARC*

{% raw %}

```yaml
0b11000{{ range(100,700) | random | int }}bc0cfe0{{ range(0,10) | random | int }}020f70
```

{% endraw %}


*Light: Lightwave RF*
{% raw %}

```yaml
0a14000{{ range(100,700) | random | int }}bc0cf{{ range(0,10) | random | int }}100f70
```

{% endraw %}


- Use this code to add a new switch in your `configuration.yaml`.
- Launch your Home Assistant and go to the website.
- Enable learning mode on your switch (i.e., push learn button or plug it in a wall socket)
- Toggle your new switch in the Home Assistant interface
